# OUR CHALLENGE - Theme Park Map Builder - Group Project

## Client
Unitainment Theme Park

## Challenge Statement
Unitainment is having a problem with long lines at the more popular rides and exhibits and empty seats at the other entertainment options. They want an interactive map of their theme park for guests to be able to find all the attractions and plan their visit. As a team, you will create this interactive map of a theme park. The park will include 8 areas with different attractions and events.


## Getting Started

> **Pro Tip:** If you find yourself writing logic on the first day of the sprint, then you did not spend enough time planning, and gaining clarification on the acceptance criteria.

1. Be sure to review your design requirements [here](https://sites.google.com/susanculkin.com/fewdd-b/design-subjects/week-8/theme-park-project). 
1. Review the [product owner's tickets](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/group-project-uix-theme-park/issues).
1. Create Firebase account for your team upload the boilerplate JSON data for use in this application.
1. Be sure to set your Firebase rules for indexing.
1. Make sure you spend time defining MVP and creating a plan to reach that goal.



## Technical Considerations
* Data is required to be requested from Firebase based on collections. Pull only what you need.
* Consider encapsulating all Firebase calls into a single module.
* Use SASS to control your color themes.
* Incorporate a CSS grid framework

## Technology Requirements
* SASS 
* Grunt (with JSHINT) 
* Promises
* Browserify
* Grid framework of your choice
* Firebase for data storage and retrieval
